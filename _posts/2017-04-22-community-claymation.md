There was no animation screening this week, as people are working on their final projects. Instead, I wanted to take a note of two animation related items. The first is a behind the scenes DVD extra about the making of Community's stop motion Christmas episode, "Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas". 

## Behind the Scenes of Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas

After last week's exploration of sound design, I thought it would be good to see the difficulties of making a physical animation and there is a ton of enlightening tidbits in the DVD extra. From the cost and complexity of the miniatures to the slow pace of actual shooting, there is an impressive amount of work put on display. <span data-balloon="I would highly recommend watching the entire show">I would highly recommend watching the episode (Season 2, Episode 11) and then watching the DVD extra</span>. However, there may be ripped videos on the internet if you were to look. 

## Double King by Felix Colgrave (9m47s)

My friend Caroline sent this to me. I thought it was well done if not very uncomfortable to watch.
