A short animation I drew for the final project of my freshman seminar, Getting Your Hands on Time, with professor Ruth Lingford. The subject of the animation was fear. 

I really enjoyed this class because it was a structured way to learn a bit more and try my hand at animation. Being able to participate in the process gives me even greater respect towards the entire practice because of the sheer difficulty of animation. Though the class may not have improved my ability to analyze animation in an aesthetic manner, it certainly has improved my ability to see the technical gears that power the animations I love.
