## Recommendations

### Orgesticulanismus by Mathieu Labaye (2008) Belgium 9m30s

I liked this animation because it a very beautiful, clean and fluid work. I never felt that the voice over was too intrusive nor did I feel that the voiceover was too overt. 

### Skhizein by Jeremy Clapin (2008) France 13m30s

I loved the idea of this animation and it is executed absolutely beautifully. Ruth discussed this film in terms of depression, but it speaks to mental illness more generally even if that is not the only human condition it discusses.

### Oozat by Darren Walsh (1992) United Kingdom 6m

Unfortunately, I cannot find the animation posted online by the artist. However, his film Angry Kid also uses the same mask pixilation technique, which I found to be incredibly compelling.
