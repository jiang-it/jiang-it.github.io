A hilarious film that is a masterful display of how to portray characters quickly while keep them believable. 

### Hedgehog in the Fog by Yuri Norstein (1975) Russia 10m30s

An old classic. The short uses a very interesting technique whose age clearly shows--I think part of the enjoyment that I receive from animation is thinking about its creation, often left only unseen through the seams of the final work.

This version may be an unofficial post to Youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rugwd8ZNHY">I believe the original (in Russian) can be found here.</a>
