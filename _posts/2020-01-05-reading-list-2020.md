I was pretty good about keeping up reading last year. Let's see if we can keep it up this year.

### The Left Hand of Darkness   
Author: Ursula K. Le Guin  
Date published: March 1969  
Date read: January 5th, 2020  

Book club book. It's of a much different form than one might expect from a science fiction book. It's more alien political and cultural understanding than action. Even though those aspects, which drive most of the plot, do not need to be set in a science fiction world, there are other elements that demand the setting. Which I think separates out this sort of book from other science fiction books. There's just more happening in this one. There's more to discover, to imaginate, to learn about of this world.
